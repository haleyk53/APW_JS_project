to run the GameCenter program first run "mongorestore --db=GameCenter .\dump\GameCenter" in the terminal while in the directory "\APW_JS_project" then run "cd APW_JS_Project" (this should place you in a directory that looks like "\APW_JS_project\APW_JS_Project")
finally "node server.js". Once the program begins running it should display a link "http://localhost:3000" if you click that link or paste it into your browser it will open up
to the GameCenter homepage where you can see the buttons for the leaderboards as well as buttons for the three currently implemented games and a button for the leaderboard page. 
from here you can play any game and the scores on the leaderboard will update in real time.
